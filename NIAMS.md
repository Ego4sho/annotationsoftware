Project Summary/Abstract
There is a significant need for advanced understanding of human kinematics in order to develop methods for optimizing sensorimotor control in health and disease, whether for guiding performance improvement or detecting degeneration that could trigger early intervention for disease or injury prevention or management. Given the proliferation of data analysis methods and computing capacity, the time is ripe for a comprehensive mapping of human movement, along with complex contextual metadata. A human multidimensional, multimodal movement atlas, or “M3A,” as a central repository suitable for sharing these data across existing and planned studies would enable any studies to continue to pay forward as an invaluable resource for new discoveries in basic and clinical science.
To support M3A, DeeperEdge is developing “m-space” as a platform technology to combine past, present, and future research data to achieve a collective goal of mapping the entire human movement “atlas”. By developing the infrastructure for the database, conversion and analysis algorithms, and user interface, we will create a lingua franca of movement to represent the disparate data input types from multiple modalities with different time scales. Proof of concept will be established in Phase I; the infrastructure will be expanded and standardized in Phase II. Extensive customer discovery activity will guide clinical/commercial directions.
The second proof of concept is clinical relevance. We hypothesize that atlas representation will be meaningful in terms of similarity of movement type as well as similarity of movement quality. To test this hypothesis in Phase I, we propose to develop proof of concept in a test population with highly specific movements and a well-established quantitative rating system of quality, using figure skating as a model system. In Phase II, we propose to test progression of movements longitudinally in the setting of two cohorts of competitive figure skaters, expected in the natural course of training either to mostly improve with practice but with the chance of worsening with injury. In Cohort A, subjects will be receiving individualized on-ice and off-ice training that will provide insight into different training strategies, with frequent on-ice measurements up to 3x/week providing insight into intraindividual test/retest variability. In Cohort B, subjects will be receiving identical on-ice and off-ice training as part of a team, providing insight into interindividual variability within a single training strategy, with weekly to monthly on-ice measurements. In both cohorts, off-ice measurements will serve as a bridging study to physical therapy-relevant assessments.
Successful completion of this project will result in a comprehensive ecosystem, with both commercial and research relevance, for storage, retrieval, and comparison of movement data that will enable insights with the power to detect multimodal, context-specific changes in human kinematics in health, disease, and life.

Project Narrative
The M3A project aims to establish a central repository of multidimensional, multimodal movement data, offering a scalable and universal platform that bridges the gap between research and commercial applications. This repository will enhance the understanding of human kinematics, facilitating the development of methods for optimizing sensorimotor control and early intervention strategies in health and disease contexts. By serving as a comprehensive hub, M3A will support the integration and analysis of movement data across diverse studies, fostering advancements in both basic and clinical sciences.

Equipment
Computer support: Given our current methods of data analysis, our computational needs are light compared to modern AI training workloads. By using mathematical models instead of data-driven unsupervised machine learning, we drastically reduce our hardware requirements. We project that a 32-core CPU paired with an NVIDIA A100 GPU will deliver our required processing power. While the movements we collect will total approximately 20 GB in size, we expect to save many intermediate or processed versions, as well as surrounding information. We do not expect to exceed 1TB in storage, and will be purchasing our data storage accordingly.
Motion Capture Hardware: For Phase I data collection, we will compare data from the first two commercially available suits: Perception Neuron Studio and Noraxon Ultium Motion. An alternative will be to use the MVN Xsens Link. Although these are excellent research options, they are less suited to chronic consumer use. Thus we will be developing our own solution in-house during Phase I in conjunction with consultants in smart textiles, motion capture, and user experience.
Our proposed in-house motion capture suit’s specifications match or exceed those currently on the market, and furthermore is designed to be low-profile and comfortable for extended use. Most importantly for feasibility, our solution will be priced within the consumer range. The primary reason for the high pricing or other commercial solutions is their data cleaning and post processing algorithms. However, our current analysis methods do not require the generated biometric models’ accuracy, or the plethora of other derived values, like joint angles. Our suit will collect at 240Hz from 21 sensors with onboard storage.

       I am acutely aware of the need for a creation of a global repository of movement data, as much of my scientific career has been dedicated to atlasing as a repository of structural and functional brain data. This is relevant both to academia and to industry, as a way to follow progression of patient disease, as well as to share data across studies, which is particularly relevant for rare diseases, where patient availability may be limited.
With a background in neurology, neurotology, neuroimaging, and neuro-ophthalmology in inherited neurodegenerative, particularly cerebellar ataxia, my expertise has been crucial in shaping the methodology behind DeeperEdge's technological approach. My years of experience working closely with electrical and computer engineering and biomedical engineering collaborators in data-driven and model- driven classification, trend modeling, and clinical correlation in the field of brain MR imaging in inherited neurodegenerative disease form the backbone of our current project. Additional experience in human measurement, from 1) parametric, non-parametric, and semi-structured neurological, neuropsychiatric, and neurocognitive assessments to 2) time series analysis of eye movement and other motor control to 3) development of EEG-based brain-computer interfaces have provided me with a unique perspective that is vital to the development of our innovative product.
As a medical doctor specializing in Neurology, I have witnessed firsthand the challenges and limitations of current technologies in healthcare. This insight has been instrumental in guiding the development of DeeperEdge, ensuring that our technology addresses these gaps effectively. My personal connection to the project is rooted in a commitment to advance medical technology for better patient outcomes.

          I am a front-end innovation and new business development leader in Internal Ventures at W.L. Gore & Associates, Inc. (“Gore”), an advanced materials company headquartered in Newark, Delaware, known for its Gore-texTM brand in waterproof, breathable materials in sports apparel, implantable medical devices, and variety of industrial products including electronics. As a new business development leader with hands-on R&D experience and patented inventions in medical device design and apparel materials, I am thrilled to express my support for DeeperEdge's innovative digital health technology proposed in this SBIR application.
I had a privilege to meet Dr. Sarah Ying, the co-founder of DeeperEdge, in 2016 when I was exploring opportunities in digital health for Gore. I led a Gore team of technologists and business associates in performing over 150 field interviews to understand market segmentation and unmet needs in digital health, spanning applications from sports to patient monitoring, using the lean startup methodology. The focus was on understanding the value proposition for Gore materials used as carriers for wearable sensors incorporated in clothing / apparel or in wearable skin patches in various market segments of digital health. Our field interviews included amateur and professional athletes, sports coaches, all major

and emerging wearable device manufacturers, biopharmaceutical industry representatives, firefighting and military experts, academic researchers, physicians, and insurers to assess unmet needs and jobs to be done from the perspective of multiple stakeholders. I have continued to support Gore innovators over the years in connecting them to the market stakeholders relevant for specific product concepts.
The insights I gained from this work revealed an enormous importance that reliable and accurate prediction of movement can have in preventing sports injuries, diagnosing progression of neuromotor diseases, monitoring the effects of medication, preventing fall in elderly, and determining points of intervention, among other potential applications like perfecting the sports game and movement, monitoring progress of physical therapy, etc. One of the major unmet needs in preventing injuries and progression of neuromotor diseases was the lack of algorithms that can reliably predict deviations in movement based on sufficient trained data sets. I believe that DeeperEdge’s ADAM technology overcomes this gap with its sensitive and accurate human movement recognition algorithm, leading to detect practical trigger points that call for intervention (rest in sports, change in therapy / medication dosing for patients, etc.). I have witnessed Dr. Sarah Ying’s commitment to advance medical technology for better patient outcomes over the years, and her dedication to find practical solutions to achieve this goal. I am confident that her DeeperEdge team has the winning potential to realize this objective.
I am serving a strategic commercial advisor to DeeperEdge and am looking forward to continuing this role with respect to customer discovery, finding the product-market fit, defining the value proposition for different market segments, and the path to commercialization and revenue. I am also committed to help DeeperEdge find partners in textile and materials industry to design practical wearable solutions for motion sensors, which enable reliable data collection and are comfortable and meet the needs and lifestyle of prospective users.
I wholeheartedly support DeeperEdge's SBIR grant proposal to further advance this incredibly important technology which has the potential to redefine care in sports and medicine and possibly other aspects of human life.

Postdoc 02/2021 Electrical Engineering
    I am interested in developing the next generation of optical imaging technologies that utilize computational techniques to augment optics hardware and enable drastic improvements in imaging resolution, speed, throughput, and simplicity. My research career began with graduate studies in Duke University’s Biomedical Engineering (BME) Department, advised by Prof. Joseph Izatt. Subsequently, I pursued a postdoc in UC Berkeley’s Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) Department with Prof. Laura Waller. My time in both BME and EECS departments has provided me interdisciplinary training in fields such as microscopy, optical design, physics-based modeling, and machine-learning. This training has given me a slightly unconventional outlook on solving bio-imaging problems, which I leverage in this proposal to develop computational microscopy techniques for deep-tissue imaging of tissue morphogenesis.
My long-term research objectives include developing these computational optics technologies into biological and clinical devices for interrogating tissue health, diagnosing disease, and monitoring treatment. My research experience includes:
1) Developing novel computational microscopy solutions for multimodal (fluorescent and label-free) super- resolution in biological samples. Key developments included theoretical formulations and experimental demonstrations of single-system super-resolution of a sample’s 3D fluorescent and refractive-index. This work led to collaborations to explore imaging applications for joint molecular-specific and biophysical/ biochemical intracellular analysis.
2) Development of novel computational frameworks utilizing nonlinear and nonconvex optimization, enabling robust reconstruction capabilities in the presence of system aberrations, multiple scattering, and non- holographic measurement. Key projects have explored the use of computation to enable scotch-tape-based super-resolution, and robust long-depth high-resolution refractive-index tomography in optically scattering biological objects.
Ongoing and recently completed projects that I would like to highlight include:

C. ContributionstoScience(frommostrecenttooldest)
1. Tomographic reconstruction through multiple scattering: Due to high optical-scattering in biological tissue, most biomedical applications of microscopy have been limited to sub-micron imaging depths. This constraint limits visualization of structures positioned beyond ~ 200 microns beneath the optical imaging surface, which limits optical imaging in important applications in clinical histology, cancer biology, neuroscience, embryology, drug discovery, etc. A promising solution may be to view optical-scattering as a computational retrieval problem – though scattering events may appear disordered, they are theoretically deterministic in nature. By illuminating a biological sample with a sequence of encoded illuminations, it may be possible to unscramble sample-induced scattering and achieve large-depth imaging. Especially with the recent advent of big-data processing, which has introduced methods such as machine-learning to analyze extremely large sets of data, such a strategy is feasible. Furthermore, the imaging hardware remains simple, making this strategy suited for standard commercial or clinical workflow. We have successfully demonstrated computational methods to reconstruct 3D refractive-index in multiple scattering objects.

2. Structured illumination super-resolution for high-throughput microscopy: This work explores the unconventional application of structured illumination (SI)-based super-resolution for high-throughput microscopy. Existing microscopes often face a tradeoff between field-of-view (FOV) size and optical resolution. This compromise poses challenges in practical applications requiring multi-scale imaging, such as cell-population studies and medical histology. Switching between wide FOVs and limited FOV zooms with sub-micron resolution manually is time-consuming and incompatible with modern digital image capture methods. Experimental demonstrations reveal that SI microscopy offers a promising solution for high-throughput imaging. By using a low-resolution imaging objective and modulating it with high-resolution illumination features, SI super-resolution methods can significantly enhance imaging resolution across the entire FOV, surpassing the objective's resolution limit.

3. Multimodal super-resolution microscopy: This work applies theoretical developments for non-fluorescent super-resolution to high-resolution optical imaging systems, enabling cutting-edge 3D super-resolution. The applications demonstrate that structured illumination (SI) is uniquely suitable for multimodal super-resolution imaging, allowing simultaneous quantitative measurements of endogenous biological parameters and molecular- specific visualizations beyond the optical diffraction limit. Unlike conventional methods like PALM, STORM, or STED, which are limited to fluorescent super-resolution, SI enables biochemical/biophysical analyses of samples. The culmination of this work resulted in a high-resolution microscope utilizing SI for robust 3D fluorescent and refractive-index super-resolution imaging of biological samples, surpassing the classical 200 nm optical diffraction limit. This work was in collaboration with Dr. Adam Wax and Dr. Will Eldridge.

4. Non-fluorescent super-resolution: This work focuses on adapting structured illumination (SI) super- resolution microscopy for non-fluorescent biological samples. Traditionally, SI microscopy has been limited to fluorescent super-resolution imaging, excluding scattering or transparent samples like tissue or unstained cells. I developed algorithms to reconstruct super-resolution images from back-scattering and transmission-based quantitative phase signals. These coherent processes required different theoretical frameworks compared to conventional fluorescent SI microscopy. Experimental demonstrations using brightfield and darkfield reflectance microscopes for back-scatter detection, and Mach-Zehnder and common-path interferometers for quantitative- phase measurements, confirmed the effectiveness of the introduced theoretical frameworks. Resolution enhancements were achieved in all coherent imaging systems, providing empirical evidence for the theoretical advancements.

5. Spectroscopic optical coherence tomography: This work developed spectroscopic optical coherence tomography (sOCT) as a noninvasive optical biopsy technique for assessing tissue health. Collaborating with Dr. Francisco Robles (assistant professor at Georgia Tech), we developed a computational time-frequency analysis technique to analyze the spatial/spectral information encoded in sOCT interferometric acquisitions.

This technique extracted 3D maps of structural and spectral characteristics, allowing quantitative assessment of clinically-relevant factors such as cell nuclei size and hemoglobin concentration/saturation, crucial biomarkers for cancer. Our findings demonstrated that sOCT as an optical biopsy approach has the potential to serve as an objective, repeatable, and noninvasive diagnostic tool for tissue interrogation.

Introduction
We thank the reviewers of our initial submission for their thoughtful and constructive feedback, which we believe has substantially improved the quality of this resubmission. We appreciate the acknowledgement of value of an atlas for human movement, “potential application in many different sectors,” strength of this “exciting and innovative concept” “leveraging the analogy of brain image space,” strength of using manual and automatic annotation, detailed plan for intra- and inter-individual variation, strong IP support, and access to MIT entrepreneur support. Changes throughout the grant are indicated in blue for convenience.
Team expertise for scientific and technical feasibility. As reflected in our Company Overview, we have recruited significant additional technical expertise to cover the every aspect of the research and commercial plan: Study Design (SY, EG, MB, SP), Model-Driven and Data-Driven Algorithm Development (SY, AL, LD, SC), Back-end Database Structure (AL, LD, SP, AY), User Interface (AL, LD), Motion Analysis (SY, EG, AL), Statistics/Applied Math (LD), Orthopedics/Sports Medicine (EG, HS), Smart Textiles and Wearable Motion Capture (AL)
Details of preliminary data. Results are outlined in more detail at the beginning of the Approach section. There is a very significant automated “data-wrangling” component (easy to conceptualize but complicated to implement), which together with the complexity of data collection and rating provides strong IP support.
Is this the best representation of movement – there is a significant body of work in human movement research not referenced. We have now extended our references to highlight some of the human movement mapping/monitoring work. Our central M3A m-space is essentially a vectorization of the standard “stick figure representation,” the movement equivalent of an SVG (as opposed to a PNG) representation of a picture. The advantage of M3A and SVG vectorized representations is that they can also be “re-lensed” to represent partial information in a different subspace, i.e. other formats. Thus M3A not only accepts but also preserves the diversity of data formats, simplifying movement archiving and analysis in a common space.
What is the roadmap to movement capture? The movements planned for Phase I figure skating were determined as meaningful through prior customer discovery efforts (MIT Sandbox, NSF Spark/Fusion). The relevant physical therapy measures for Phase II will be determined through planned Phase I customer discovery activity and will be further refined on the basis of movement characteristics observed in Phase I data collection. Ultimately, by understanding intra- and inter-individual variability in m-space, we will be able to develop a heuristic guide to the minimum necessary training set to define a new m-space in a new movement vertical, reducing the necessary training set by orders of magnitude.
How will m-space be used by end-users? Because m-space is vectorized, it is easy to define one’s state as a fractional position between the least desired state and the most desired state. However, the true power is when that position is secondarily mapped to empirically defined clinical outcomes, indicating “risk of injury,” “time to wheelchair,” etc.
Hardware specifications. Now described in the Equipment section. We share the reviewer’s concerns about the practicality of wearing the sensors chronically, and with additional customer discovery have extended the Phase I by 9 months and recruited smart textile expertise.
Business Model. New, short-term commercialization projections are included, based on continued customer discovery efforts. By integrating our product into the existing clinical workflow, it becomes natural to tie reimbursement to a CPT code, in a revenue share model.
Healthcare impact. Our Phase II study will support entry to the sports medicine/physical therapy market; afterward, clinical trials need to be performed in dedicated patient populations. Clinical trials will be identified, designed, and pitched for funding, based on planned customer discovery interviews.
Protections for Human Subjects. Our IRB and FWA are now registered.
Inclusion of Women, Minorities, and Individuals Across the Lifespan. POC will start in homogenous
populations, then be broadened to include diverse demographics and disease.

Specific Aims
Goal: There is a significant need for advanced understanding of human kinematics in order to develop methods for assessing and optimizing sensorimotor control in health and disease, whether for guiding performance improvement or detecting degeneration that could trigger early intervention for disease or injury prevention or management. A multidimensional, multimodal movement atlas, or “M3A,” as a central repository suitable for sharing these data across existing and planned studies would enable any studies to continue to pay forward as an invaluable resource for new discoveries in basic and clinical science. In order to demonstrate that such an atlas could be both feasible and useful, we propose to test the functional utility of a common movement space, or “m-space,” in a novel application, wherein a movement’s location in m-space can represent both classification and rating. In Phase I we provide proof of concept of m-space by building infrastructure for movement recognition and developing commercialization support. In Phase II we provide proof of concept of M3A by 1) expanding the digital infrastructure, 2) demonstrating incorporation of multimodal data from a substantial real-world pilot population, and 3) validating our capacity to comprehensively map human movement in a clinically meaningful fashion, not only using prescribed movements, but also movements captured “in the wild,” as well as complex contextual metadata.
Significance: Developing a comprehensive database infrastructure to gather, harmonize, and share this information will be instrumental for ongoing and future research, contributing greatly to scientific and medical advancements. In particular, this method addresses a significant gap in current clinical management and clinical trials. Existing movement analysis approaches may examine biomechanical parameters closely, whether position or its derivatives, variability, etc., but are limited to a handful of specific movements, leaving a significant gap in the ability to recognize/distinguish the broad range of human activity present in daily life. More broadly, this SBIR Fast-Track proposal aligns with the NIH mandate not only to support basic, translational, and clinical science but also to facilitate coordination and dissemination of these research efforts, supporting digital biomarkers for diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation of neurological and musculoskeletal function through both pathogenesis and salutogenesis.
Approach: With the growth in data analysis techniques and computing power, we are now in a strategic position to create a detailed map of prescribed and free movements, taking clinical and other related data into account. Our solution addresses the issue of universal recognition by bootstrapping a self-expanding set of labeled movements that are algorithmically amenable to scaling. This will form the basis of “M3A,” an atlas of human kinematics that provides for computational intercomparability of multimodal movement data.
Prior Work: We had originally demonstrated the ability to identify individual movements from a continuous stream, mapping them into a continuous vector space indicative of both identity and subtle changes in quality of a given movement, specifically degeneration of form in a fatigue model. Now, newly recruited expertise has enabled additional supporting data: 1) UMAP implementation supporting robust classification, and 2) computational intercomparability by mapping multiple individuals into the same m-space.
Phase I Aims: (1) develop a prototype database and user interface infrastructure to demonstrate the ability to collect and display data from multiple modalities with different time scales, for video and data from two wearable sensor systems, all in the context of additional relevant clinical metadata; (2) develop a prototype database and user interface infrastructure to demonstrate the ability to annotate, label, and rate individual movements, referencing the ratings through a movement-specific index; (3) test the hypothesis that data show unique movement-specific characteristics amenable to automated movement classification in a dimensionally reduced movement space, or “m-space”; (4) test the hypothesis that m-space metrics are sensitive to subtle change in performance, using a fatigue model of performance degeneration; (5) support commercial/clinical feasibility by determining product-market workflow fit through customer discovery interviews, defining clinically relevant prescribed and free-form movements for Phase II and future Phase III clinical trials, and developing wearable sensor hardware to support commercial adoption beyond research.
Phase II Aims: (1) expand the database and user interface infrastructure to collect and display data collected in the wild in the context of additional relevant clinical metadata; (2) expand the database and user interface infrastructure to automatically annotate, label, and rate individual movements performed in the wild, referencing the ratings through a movement-specific index; (3) test the hypothesis that longitudinal change is amenable to manifold modeling in a dimensionally reduced movement space; (4) test the hypothesis that m-space metrics can be used for development of injury risk models; and (5) establish commercial feasibility by interviewing medical stakeholders, manufacturing partners, potential customers.

Significance
Research Strategy
There is a significant need for advanced understanding of human kinematics in order to develop methods for assessing and optimizing sensorimotor control in health and disease, whether for guiding performance improvement or detecting degeneration that could trigger early intervention for disease or injury prevention or management. With the growth in data analysis techniques and computing power, we are now in a strategic position to create a detailed map of human movements, taking clinical and other related data into account. Developing a comprehensive, diverse database infrastructure to gather, harmonize, and share this information will be instrumental for ongoing and future research, contributing greatly to scientific and medical advancements. Although our proposed classification could be achieved with data-driven AI methods using millions upon millions of unlabeled samples, we will use model-driven expert verification to train using thousands of examples. This foundational work will ultimately enable training with only hundreds of examples, thus accelerating development of diverse clinical applications with broad commercial potential.
Proposing a multidimensional, multimodal movement atlas as a central repository of movement data and associated clinical data. A multidimensional, multimodal movement atlas, or “M3A,” as a central repository suitable for sharing these data across existing and planned studies would enable any studies to continue to pay forward as an invaluable resource for new scientific discoveries. Such a tool is crucial for enhancing understanding, from neurodegenerative movement disorders to other conditions involving impairment of sensorimotor control. This is key not only as a research tool, but as a potential biomarker for diagnosis, prognosis, clinical monitoring, response to therapy, and risk/safety assessment.
Atlasing as a spatial index of information; advantages of spatial representation as a searchable vector space. There is considerable precedent for comprehensive “atlasing” solutions, wherein complex data can be referenced using a spatial index, similar to global coordinates in an atlas of the world. The concept of spatial indexing is quite intuitive in the case of stereotactic brain mapping, where spatial coordinates have both an anatomic label and a functional significance. Preservation of higher dimensional relationships enables visualization of the data through various lenses, as in the brain imaging analogy, where brain information has myriad spatial representations as a surface reconstruction, axial/ sagittal/ coronal slices, even incorporating information from different imaging sequences/ analyses/ modalities, whether MR (T1/T2/diffusion, etc.), CT, fluoro, or even pathology. Ideally, a dynamic spatial indexing, whether serving as a somatotopic representation in stereotactic space in the brain analogy, or in this case representing a more abstract quality such as a movement type in m-space, could allow for ever-deeper investigation into subcategories of movement analysis. Because this m-space references all movements not as a categorical list, but as a continuous vector space, additional subtleties of movement variation are also encoded.
Dimensional reduction required for movement atlasing, modeling movements and functional changes of interest. However, in the case of movement, which represents more than 3 dimensions of change, the situation is more complex, and a dimensional reduction technique must be employed, in order to represent a complex movement as a single location in 3D or other lower dimensional space, which we call "m-space." Thus, to support M3A, DeeperEdge is developing “m-space” as a platform technology to combine past, present, and future research data to achieve a collective goal of mapping the entire human movement “atlas”. We hypothesize that atlas representation, wherein a single point will represent a short sample of full body movement (e.g. the equivalent of a stick figure reconstruction lifting up a glass of water to drink), will be meaningful in terms of similarity of movement type as well as movement quality.
A “lingua franca'' for harmonization with other movement representations. The value of many studies lies in strategically chosen, highly specialized measurements e.g. a treadmill or a pressure mat, without need for recording full body movement. Because our central M3A m-space is a vectorization of the standard “stick figure representation,” but can also represent partial information as a subspace, it not only accepts but also preserves data format diversity while providing a tractable representational control structure for archiving and analysis of movement. Then, in order to reference the “native” form via our “lingua franca” form, bridging studies could guide development of modular software tools for intercompatible transformation among not only the existing large-scale motion databases (which are large, but not large enough for true unsupervised learning) but also the vast movement analysis literature currently accessed as stand-alone studies.
Research Strategy Page 70

 Contact PD/PI: Ying, Sarah
Harmonization with other clinically relevant metadata. Another consideration is the importance of harmonization of data. There have already been efforts toward creating common data elements to capture the most common features. However, many measurements may represent very different time scales, from movement at 200Hz and video at 30Hz to categorical patient reported outcomes twice a year. There are some notable examples of public/private partnerships that have positively affected patient outcomes.
Preserving commercial opportunity. There are far-ranging applications for this M3A platform for knowledge organization and aggregation once the science of the m-space subdimensions is developed and verified, not only for prescribed movements but for free-form, real-world movements. These applications could be as diverse as: 1) serving as a digital outcome measure for a movement disorders clinical trial 2) extending physical therapy resources by enabling remote monitoring (billable by CPT code), or 3) simply supporting athletic performance improvement by tabulating practice movements, identifying areas for improvement, and monitoring risk for injury. Because of the variability of these movements (particularly in diseased states, and even more so in real-world movements), it would take a vast labeled training set to build and understand any one of these movement spaces directly by brute force. However, by exploring and codifying the rules of m-space in one application, we can establish a heuristic for defining m-space in the next application, strategically bootstrapping the scope of m-spaces within M3A for future research and clinical applications.
Innovation
We support future development of a comprehensive multidimensional, multimodal movement atlas for humans that we call “M3A'' by developing a movement lingua franca that we call “m-space,” and demonstrating its utility. Although m-space is conceptualized as a universal moment index, movements can examined more granularly on a practical level through the lens of an individualized m-space subdimension, such as “figure skaters at risk for hip injuries'' or “ataxia patients at risk for falling.” These approaches will be enabled and analyzed through our innovative movement-specific analysis platform, a novel approach that brings together aspects of the PI’s prior published work (c.f. bibliography of internal references), which was performed together with an extensive network of collaborators (which of itself will be a valuable additional resource). Although the current AI explosion could accomplish all that we are suggesting if we only had thousands of labeled examples of each performance subdimension of each movement, this would require a labeled movement repository in the billions. Nevertheless, a smaller, more tractable dataset can still be informative to well-established approaches to mapping brain structure and function, specifically semi-automated and automated image processing algorithms used in brain MR imaging. The final platform leverages the PI’s experience with machine learning, trend modeling through dimensional reduction, time series data, physiologic adaptation, digital outcome measures with clinical correlations, and rare diseases, all here adapted for movement analysis. We have recruited expertise in movement science, computer science, hardware, and orthopedics/sports, for every aspect of the research and development.
Although the approaches are well established, all data collection and analysis methods were developed in-house specifically for this application. Preliminary data indicate not only the ability to classify movements (Ying, Neuroscience 2021; Ying, Neuroscience 2023; unpublished UMAP results), but also the potential to identify performance-related deviations from standard movements. Degeneration of form (with fatigue) correlated with movement through m-space, suggesting its applicability in detecting other changes in performance, e.g. those related to medical conditions (neurodegeneration, musculoskeletal injury/recovery).
Our “secret sauce” is strategic selection of well-defined movements to ground our understanding of m-space. Once we have well-defined coverage of one movement space, then we can calculate the optimum minimum training set from which our understanding of more variable movements for a new m-space, particularly the infinite variety of movements in daily life. Specifically, we have chosen the field of figure skating as an ideal model population because there is a well-prescribed set of named movements which have a very detailed rating system yet exhibit significant individual variability and change even in a short period of time, whether through performance improvement, degeneration through injury, or simply evolution of artistic expression. Moreover, recruitment and data collection are very efficient because competitive athletes practice for many hours per day in one spot. Though a small market, it is crucial for supporting the key foundational science necessary to guide statistically robust conversion from structured movement space to unstructured movement space. This exquisite specificity provides statistical power in small sample sizes, essentially the commercial equivalent of a rare disease approach enabling POC to support larger but less specific diseases.

The core of our movement-specific technical innovation includes:
1) Movement-Specific Analysis: Our approach is designed for assessing, following, and correcting movements, with the capacity to incorporate various types of digital data. This versatility coupled with its specificity for individual movements makes it a powerful tool for a broad spectrum of applications.
2) Customized Movement Space (m-space): We have developed a unique concept of 'm-space', a dimensionally reduced movement space enabling conceptualization and characterization of distinct movement patterns. This can provide a nuanced approach to movement analysis, whether generalized to map all human movements or tailored to provide a personalized lens, mapping movements specific to a subgroup or even an individual. Transformations between subdimensions are mathematically invertible, enabling interconversion among different m-spaces, including the central universal m-space.
3) Correlation with Movement Quality: The ability to map movements within m-space and correlate their locations with movement quality is a crucial feature. This was evident in our preliminary data, where changes in m-space locations correlated with performance variations due to fatigue. Such mapping could be instrumental in monitoring progression and predicting outcomes in various medical contexts.
This proposed numerical m-space representation of movement form and degeneration poses a series of applied mathematical analysis challenges that we know well. From a computational standpoint, the problems we are trying to solve in motion recognition and rating can be thought of as being analogous to the methods used in modeling degeneration of the brain surface.
In brain modeling, the cerebral cortex can be thought of as a three-dimensional structure composed of smaller three-dimensional structures called lobes, each of which has a specific function. Within any given lobe, different areas may serve different functions. Degeneration of the cortical surface will result in movement of that surface away from its original location, yet with some preservation of relative structure. The identity of the lobe can be grossly defined using a probabilistic atlas (to assign a preliminary label), then refined using topological and connectivity constraints. Once the lobe is labeled, then mapping local deviations of the test lobe from the ideal lobe can identify patterns of degeneration, which may have physiologic and pathophysiologic significance.
Brain surface analysis is thus analogous to our current problem, i.e. classification of a given movement and deviation of that movement from the ideal. The only conceptual leap is that you are taking a movement—technically 4-dimensional as you have a 3-dimensional object moving through time—and
     Research Strategy Page 72

representing the entire movement as a single point in a 3-dimensional "movement space" (m-space). This can be accomplished by using the first 3 PC's in the PCA (principal component analysis) space, where each step is represented by a ~40,000 dimensional feature space, representing 21 wearable sensors x 6 channels x 314 time points. After that, the mathematical approach is perfectly analogous to the brain surface analysis in regular spatial 3-D coordinates.
Basically, a given instance of an ice dance step (represented in 3-D m-space) can be classified using a probabilistic atlas of dance steps. Then, an individual test subject's set (all examples of a single given dance step) forms a “step manifold" in m-space, filling space in the same way that a lobe of the brain fills space. Think of the coordinates of a set of "right progressive" dance steps as being similar to the coordinates
included in a "right frontal lobe," or the coordinates of a set of "right swing roll" dance steps as being like a "right parietal lobe."
Perfect dance steps (as performed by elite competitive skaters) can be imagined as the surface of the normal (ideal) brain, whereas the imperfect dance steps performed by a given test subject can be imagined as a "degeneration" or other spatial shift from the ideal surface.
The shape of the degenerated surface reveals *how* the test subject deviates
from normal and could be very informative as to *what* is wrong, from the musculoskeletal function perspective. This could even be a testable hypothesis, e.g. we can compare two groups with gluteus medius dysfunction (patients who are known to have gluteus medius weakness and patients whom we put through a fatigue protocol to specifically tire out the gluteus medius) and show that
they exhibit the same deviations from ideal, essentially a mode of degeneration.
By setting up a 1:1 correspondence between the test subject's manifold and the ideal manifold and mapping the evolution required to superimpose the two, it is possible to model the change required to improve or "fix" the test subject's movement. For example, comparison of the full manifold could identify areas of particular interest, such as “gluteus medius weakness.” (c.f. Conceptualization of data flow)
Additionally, by following the evolution of a test subject's manifold over time, it is possible to forecast how the movement will be performed if the current trend continues, which could have important medical implications. For example, if we could *predict* that a subject will soon develop movements that represent dysfunctional compensation for musculoskeletal dysfunction (a red flag for injury risk), then this method could serve as an early indicator of injury risk and trigger early intervention with physical therapy.
Approach
Key Preliminary Findings: In our analyses of the Dutch Waltz (1 skater performing 4 sets of 10 patterns; 3 skaters each performing 1-2 sets of 3 patterns) using 17 Noitom Perception Neuron inertia IMU sensors to analyze individual dance steps, we published: 1) nearest-neighbor template matching provided a model-driven classification accuracy of 94-100% (Ying 2023) defining the ceiling of our ideal product profile. Unpublished findings: 2) a sliding window provided similar classification accuracy from a continuous stream (unpub); 3) mapping steps into a continuous vector space (PCA) indicated both step identity and subtle changes in quality of a given movement, specifically degeneration of form in a fatigue model After correction for multiple comparisons, then R/L/straight step groupings or individual step types were different from each other (p<0.001, Hotelling's T-squared statistic). PCA coordinates and IJS Skating Skills component score (SSCS) for early/late sets for distinct step types were also different (p<0.001). SSCS’s correlated with PCA coordinates according to the appropriate PC dimension (R>0.7, p<0.05); 4) UMAP supported robust data-driven classification (visualized above); 5) feasibility of computational intercomparability was shown by mapping multiple individuals into the same m-space (not shown).
To address the issue of individual variation, classification of dance steps will not rely on direct pattern recognition. We have already observed that movements are not normally distributed in m-space. Our preliminary results demonstrate the power of UMAP to provide data-driven classification with small sample sizes. Other potential approaches include optimization of the distance metric/cost function, higher dimensional distribution modeling, creating an individualized vs universal template, using multiple templates, using a “dictionary” approach with all labeled examples, etc. The initial training set will be manually segmented and later augmented in a semi-automated fashion. Additional features such as edge or direction,

as well as expert, multidimensional ratings and other contextual metadata, including clinical and user-reported data, will be serially incorporated, eventually training an ensemble with a random forest algorithm or other non-parametric approaches. Our proposed data set will enable an understanding of intra/inter individual and group variability, but a more comprehensive “real world” data set, orders of magnitude larger, can be achieved after commercialization. As we reach a critical mass of number of steps and samples, including augmentation of training set size through perturbation of samples, it would be reasonable to also explore unsupervised learning
approaches, e.g. using a stacked autoencoder (see figure, Yang, 2014) to develop data-driven feature representation of the input data. As these represent modes of degeneration, content experts will review them for interpretability, identifying potential intervention strategies. Conversely, movement signatures for known diagnoses/dysfunctions can also be defined as an m-space subdimension.
The commercial viability and impact of our project are underpinned by its robustness, which is a key factor for voluntary adoption. By achieving widespread adoption, we expect to expand and deepen our knowledge engine exponentially, enhancing the overall impact and effectiveness of our technology. Our project goes beyond the realms of straightforward engineering and extensive data collection. It involves complex development work to model higher-dimensional trajectories of movement evolution, bridging the gap between on-ice and off-ice movements, and incorporating clinical relevance through contextual metadata.
We will evaluate framework robustness using iterative subsampling. First, we will define the variability within each step to enable detection of short-term change (e.g. fatigue) or to understand the trajectory of long-term change (e.g. effect of an intervention). Second, we will leverage the continuous vector space to understand the knowledge-based relationships between steps (e.g. rocker:counter::3-turn:bracket) in order to: a) inform training strategies, b) help skating-specific m-space to grow beyond pre-defined movements, and c) establish the basis for m-space syntax to translate from skating-specific to real-life movements. Third, we will use these properties to: a) compensate for missing data due to sensor dropout, making our approach usable under real world conditions, b) define a universal m-space suitable for inter-individual comparison, and c) optimize the sparsest training set necessary to define a personalized m-space, whether specific to an individual, to a diagnosis, or to a type of movement (ice dance steps vs physical therapy tests vs activities of daily living).
Inherent in the issue of variability is the idea that location in m-space may have functional significance, whether demonstrating increasing skill mastery, developing dysfunctional movement patterns, or simply performing a move with different artistic interpretation. Thus, the long-term progression-trajectory of an individual’s performance of a given step will be modeled as a curve, embedded in a step-specific manifold of small dimension, embedded in turn in m-space. Short-term forecasting can indicate either progress toward a performance goal or worsening of form (indicating risk for injury) and will be addressed in Phase II.
Clinical impact. Ultimately we expect to identify changes in form, represented by a shift in location in m-space, that may provide an early indicator of change, whether responding to therapy or moving into a danger zone. This could provide a simple metric of a movement’s performance, i.e. a scaled distance between inactivity and perfect execution of a movement, and could
be measured either in the clinic or in daily life. By providing a new m-space metric of performance that is continuous and quantitative, there may be earlier detection. By monitoring an m-space metric in daily life, there is a chance that earlier detection could even occur in between scheduled visits. Most of all, by simplifying the clinical visit and providing standard measures that can be collected by a practitioner extender, the physiatric professional’s time can be freed up for more complex decision-making.
Phase I: proof of concept of m-space in ice dance as a highly structured model system, with development of hardware for real world data collection
          Research Strategy Page 74

 Contact PD/PI: Ying, Sarah
Our Phase I project is structured to establish the technical feasibility of our m-space framework in a model system. This will serve as proof of concept and foundation for development of a comprehensive multidimensional, multimodal movement atlas. M-space is a pioneering technology designed to understand the intricate relationships between movements in various clinical contexts.
Essentially, a complex movement will be represented as a single point in 3D space (or other relatively low dimension). This will generate an m-space model specific to the well-defined and well-quantified International Skating Union ice dance pattern dances as our model system. The commercial approach is initially targeted towards the Figure Skating market and closely associated physical therapy care. This strategy has been carefully crafted to lay a solid foundation for bridging the gap stepwise from prescribed on-ice movements to real-world off-ice movements (which lack a formalized rating system that are too variable in individual performance to define the properties of an m-space). This is particularly critical as it opens pathways to apply our technology in other verticals marked by movement impairments, such as neurological disorders or other sensorimotor impairment. By the end of Phase I, we expect to have validated our proof of concept, built out the software framework necessary for data collection at scale, and developed a prototype for limited release.
Phase I, Aim #1: to develop a prototype database and user interface infrastructure to demonstrate the ability to collect and display data from multiple modalities with different time scales, for video and data from two wearable sensor systems (Noitom Perception Neuron and Noraxon Ultium Motion), all in the context of additional relevant clinical metadata. We further hypothesize that we can create a “lingua franca'' of movement to represent the disparate data input types, with interclass correlation (ICC) of >80% minimum, >90% target, >95% ideal (achieved by model-driven classification with a personalized template).
- Engineering Deliverable. Development of a back-end database for storage of video footage, raw data, processed data, demographic data, and other metadata. The system will be flexible enough for future features such as: separation of identifiers from PHI; customizable data sharing so that users can choose who (coaches, parents, medical team, other trainees, friends, etc.) sees what data; and enabling researchers to create data sets, etc.
- Data Acquisition. 150K movement (ice dance step) sample training set. Standardized music will be precut to collect the following datasets: Comprehensive (all dances, 5 individuals, 10 iterations [all dances forward], 10 iterations [all dances, reverse order to assess fatigue]; High Level dances (10 individuals, 10 iterations, 4 pre-gold/gold dances, 4 prelim-sliver dances, Dutch Waltz); Lower Level dances (10 individuals, 10 iterations, 4 prelim-silver dances, Dutch Waltz); Focused (25 individuals, 10 iterations, Dutch Waltz). To demonstrate feasibility, we have already identified >50% of participants.
- R&D Objective. R&D aspects of this objective include interim analysis of acquisition protocols, comparison of hardware capabilities of wearable sensor systems.
Phase I, Aim #2: to develop a prototype database and user interface infrastructure to annotate, label, and rate individual movements, referencing the ratings through a movement-specific index. We hypothesize that movements in a dimensionally reduced space will cluster according to ratings.
- Engineering Deliverable. Development of a flexible internal user interface for rating. Key features include: synchronized visualization and annotation of video, time series data, and stick figure reconstruction; presentation of “Captcha-like” snippets of synchronized video/data/stick figure samples to be identified (steps can be labeled by experienced skaters) or rated (GOE, components, etc. must be rated by experienced judges); an ergonomically friendly rating table to click through efficiently, including keyboard commands; and randomization of samples.
- R&D Objective. High quality data annotation: classification and rating. The first major task is classification of a movement into step type. This starts with expert manual classification of a few iterations to establish a written definition of the step, ensure an accurate template, and assess variability. In the next stage, steps will be split up by timing, then presented in isolation for validation. Review of the surrounding time immediately before or afterward will ensure precise demarcation of the beginning and end of a step. Validation will require two raters; in the case of discrepancy, a committee of 3 will adjudicate by consensus, editing the written criteria for each step as necessary. Eventually, steps will receive a preliminary classification using the ever-evolving automated method, then be validated manually as in Aim #3.
       Research Strategy Page 75

Phase I, Aim #3: to test the hypothesis that data show unique movement-specific characteristics
amenable to automated movement classification in a dimensionally reduced movement space, or “m-space,” with ICC>80% minimum, >90% target, and >95% ideal.
- Engineering Deliverable. Development of a flexible internal user interface for data analysis/classification. Key features include modular analysis “dance cards,” somewhat like punch cards, by which an analysis pipeline may be built in a modular fashion. Users will choose: files to classify; metadata; analysis approach (direct vs hierarchical, may iterate using adaptive selections of combinations); template (mean vs categorical/individual vs dictionary, etc.); error metric (other distance metrics vs enhanced feature vector); classification (voting scheme vs hierarchical).
- R&D Objective. Algorithm development: classification. Optimizing the classification algorithm will be an iterative process. Our team will assess different variations of dimensional reduction, cost function, integration of metadata, voting scheme, then combine these efforts in a hierarchical fashion to maximize separation at each step. We will begin with unsupervised clustering methods to determine natural modes of robust separation, then pre-separate on model-driven categories such as left vs right, front vs back, turns vs continuous, and clockwise vs counterclockwise to see if an m-space created from a more limited subset can permit more robust separation of the next set. Our preliminary results have already demonstrated robust separation with non-linear methods such as UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction), which finds a low dimensional projection of the data that has the closest possible equivalent fuzzy topological structure; we will explore other methods, such as t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), which uses gradient descent to minimize the divergence between the probability distribution of the higher and lower dimensional representations, or. Absolute mean error as a cost function was already improved by using root mean squared error, but logarithmic transformation, Mahalanobis distance, or other means to de-emphasize outliers could be explored. For each approach, exploratory iteration will continue until classification quality reaches a plateau; failures will be manually examined for unusual features that may define a separate category for classification. Overall, our target classification metric is a combined overall median Dice coefficient of minimum >0.8, ideal >0.95.
- R&D Objective. Algorithm development: building probabilistic atlases of step identity and rating. It would be straightforward to build a probabilistic atlas of step identity on the basis of an arbitrary m-space, such as the linear PCA-based space in the pilot studies. However, depending on the intra- versus inter-factor variability, whether comparing individuals, dance, step, level of experience (competition experience, highest dance passed, etc.), quality (rater scores), or even body size, it may be advantageous to alter the sequence of transformations to better reflect the classifications determined in R&D Objective #3, such that location in the enhanced m-space would more accurately predict classification. Then, when building a second probabilistic atlas of step rating, it may be helpful to design a step-specific m-space such that location in step-specific m-space can best predict the rating. Again our minimum target metric is a combined overall median Dice coefficient of >0.8, ideal >0.95.
Phase I, Aim #4: to test the hypothesis that m-space metrics are sensitive to subtle change in performance, using a fatigue model of performance degeneration, with R>0.8 min, >0.9 target, >0.95 ideal.
- Engineering Deliverable. Development of a flexible end-user interface for data summary review. Key features include: entry of metadata; multiple parameters over time (past session, day, week, month, year, lifetime); comparison with others (team mates, idealized version, self-when-not-injured); selection of sharing (coach, friends, medical team); gamification element (badges, leaderboards, etc.)
- R&D Objective. Algorithm development: step-specific manifold modeling. Whereas each of the previous objectives can be independently achieved, this step will be highly dependent on the accomplishment of the preceding objectives to provide sufficient training data efficiently. Nonlinear methods such as entropy, maximum Lyapunov exponent, autocorrelation or recurrence fluctuation analysis provide a measure of temporal variability and may provide some insight into the integrity of the underlying motor control system. This will inform our modeling of behavior, whether through defining streamlines, quality correlation zones, finite element modeling, level set evolution, forecasting approaches, or other transforms. Although the only model of form degeneration that we are testing during this Phase I study is the fatigue model (degeneration after 10 patterns), we are building the framework to study other causes of longitudinal form progression, whether improvement through training, medium-term exhaustion by the end of a week of
       Research Strategy Page 76

 Contact PD/PI: Ying, Sarah
training, improvement during injury recovery, etc. Although the eventual purpose of modeling the manifold is to serve as a scaffold for monitoring future form degeneration, for this Phase I study, goodness-of-fit as a model will be determined by classification accuracy, with target combined median Dice coefficient >0.8.
Phase I, Aim #5: support commercial/clinical feasibility by determining product-market workflow fit through customer discovery interviews, defining clinically relevant prescribed and free-form movements for Phase II and future Phase III clinical trials, and developing wearable sensor hardware to support commercial adoption.
- Commercial Feasibility Objective. Product fit with end users. We have already begun significant customer discovery work through the MIT I-Corps Spark and Fusion programs, the MIT Sandbox program, and the MIT Venture Mentoring Service. Awarding of this SBIR Phase I would enable us to apply via PAR-22-073 to the ‘I-Corps at NIH’ program for further guidance in customer discovery and business model validation, for a total of 100 customer discovery interviews.
- Clinical Feasibility Objective. Integration into clinical workflow. Customer discovery interviews with orthopedic departments and physical therapy centers will not only define CPT-sensitive workflow models but also determine which outcome measures will be most relevant for use in the planned Phase II as well as subsequent Phase 3 clinical verticals.
- Engineering Deliverable. Development of a commercializable motion capture hardware solution (IMU suit). Currently, existing motion capture systems are too expensive, too cumbersome, or both, for chronic use. In order to provide a solution suitable for chronic use, perhaps through integration into clothing, economical enough to be able to have multiple clothing items in rotation for daily use, we have recruited a team and allocated additional time to develop custom integration of sensors, textiles, etc. with potential partners, vs. algorithmic compensation. We believe that we will overcome the barrier of expensive hardware drift compensation, because our m-space
ecosystem already compensated for drift. As this solution for Phase II is being developed, we will continue to collect our Phase I data using the Noitom Perception Neuron Studio and Noraxon Ultium Motion systems.
Critical Phase I milestones include: 1) engineering a back-end
database, computational framework for modular analysis, user
interface; 2) stabilization of hardware implementation, with a
usable motion capture suit with data capture to either a laptop or
a portable hub; 3) sufficient data collection to build initial
algorithms for movement classification and rating. By the end of
Phase I, we expect a full proof of concept of the m-space
analysis platform, a design for a real-world-friendly wearable
sensor solution, and full market fit informed by our customer discovery efforts. Taken together, these demonstrate feasibility as well as preliminary POC for the M3A atlasing platform, which is key not only for these proposed commercial verticals, but can serve as the basis for thoughtful aggregation of all movement research data.
Phase II: proof of concept of M3A as a universal human movement atlas, using multimodal data integration to follow free-form skating longitudinally in a medical context.
In Phase II, to further develop the ecosystem for storage, retrieval, and comparison of movement data, the m-space will be expanded to complex on-ice movements and constrained off-ice movements, which will be a stepping stone to truly free movements in daily life. This will serve as proof of concept of the M3A as an atlas for repository of disparate data types relevant to human movement, as well as building up a central core of standard physical therapy (off-ice) assessments that can serve as a Rosetta stone to incorporate other methods of measuring human movement.
Specifically, this will entail a broader array of on-ice movements found in a typical free dance or free skate, including complex turns, diverse postures, spins, jumps, or partner elements such as lifts, with the appropriate incorporation of various levels and ratings into our system. We will also extend our study to different types of off-ice movement, instrumenting some standard non-instrumented scales of balance, coordination, and neurological function as well as collecting some more natural movements. We will also
      Research Strategy Page 77

 Contact PD/PI: Ying, Sarah
assess test-retest variability in the immediate as well as over time intervals in order to perform power calculations for detecting change in the longitudinal setting, using carefully selected cohorts. As we iterate through increasingly accurate classification algorithms, accumulating larger and larger labeled training sets, we will develop increasing specificity through a combination of unsupervised and supervised learning approaches that may be applied in a hierarchical fashion to achieve meaningful outcomes.
Throughout Phase II, not only will we build the foundational data sets and algorithms to universalize the M3A, but efforts will also enable a staged commercial rollout, which will provide access to additional real-world data for testing and training. Building end-user buy-in, we will provide increased complexity of feedback to the user as follows: Stage 1 (Aim #1) Classification–individualized m-space without ratings, helpful for skaters; Stage 2 (Aim #2) Ratings–universal m-space including ratings, helpful for coaches and skaters; Stage 3 (Aim #4) Progression–manifold modeling, helpful for coaches, skaters and medical team.
Phase II, Aim #1: Expand the database and user interface infrastructure to collect and display data collected in the wild from multiple modalities with different time scales, in the context of additional relevant clinical metadata. This will result in a collection of a highly curated dataset with a wide variety of movements and expert knowledge in the form of detailed ratings that will serve not only as a basis for development of content-specific algorithms in the later aims, but will be comprehensive enough to develop guidelines for the sparset data set necessary to train either expansion of the existing m-space or de novo development of an m-space in a different area.
- Data acquisition. ~2 million movements to be collected longitudinally during real-life training sessions on and off the ice. The data set from Phase I examined on-ice movements performed to strict timing. Now, we will collect on-ice movements with undefined timing, which may vary by up to an order of magnitude. Additionally, we will collect off-ice movements with more restricted timing, helping to bridge our comprehensive knowledge of on-ice movements to the new domain of on-ice movements and also develop a basis for future integration of new movement domains into a central atlas. This movement data will be complemented by comprehensive context-specific metadata, representing both traits and states, all of which will be determined through clinical feasibility discovery work in Phase I, Aim #5.
- Cohort A. Intra-individual and inter-regimen variability will be assessed in a cohort of competitive skating athletes receiving personalized skating instruction, over 2 years. A typical training schedule consists of 6 practice days per week, with an average of 4 hours of on-ice practice and 1 hour of off-ice practice each day. On-ice evaluations will encompass a routine practice session, with the addition of a standard 10 minute series of movements once per week. Off-ice evaluations will involve simple instrumentation of the standard off-ice regimen, with the addition of the 10 minute standard assessment.
Approximately 5 subjects will be recruited for the “frequent” group, with measurement of at least 2 on-ice sessions 3x/week. They will receive on-ice assessments frequently for a year, then receive on-ice assessments weekly for the next 8 months, with the option to be assessed more frequently. One final assessment will occur at M20. Approximately 5 subjects will be recruited for the “weekly” group, and will be assessed during 2 on-ice sessions once a week for the full 20 months. Approximately 10 subjects will be recruited for the “off-ice” group, and will receive instrumented off-ice assessments (established in Phase I Aim 5 Clinical Feasibility Objective) once every 2 months for 20 months. The “frequent” group and the “weekly” groups will also be assessed off-ice every 2 months, on the same schedule. A low dropout rate is expected, approximately 1-2 skaters.
- Cohort B. Inter-individual variability within a stereotyped training regimen will be assessed in a cohort of competitive synchronized skating athletes. A typical team training schedule consists of 3 practices per week, with an average of 2 hours of on-ice practice and 1 hour of off-ice practice. One of the 3 on-ice days consists of “skills and drills,” during which the entire team participates in the same skating exercises. Skaters may optionally skate on their own for practice or with private coaching. On-ice evaluations will take place on a skills and drills day; off-ice evaluations will involve simple instrumentation of the standard off-ice regimen, plus a 10-15 minute standard assessment.
Participants will be recruited from a single synchronized skating team consisting of 24 members, for 18 months of followup. Of the 24 members, 8 will be recruited for the “weekly” group, and will receive on-ice assessments for 2 hours per week for 10 months. During each 2-month epoch, it is to be expected that subjects will participate at least 6 of the 8 weeks, as skaters may be absent for competition or competition
 Research Strategy Page 78

 Contact PD/PI: Ying, Sarah
preparation. 8 skaters will be recruited for the “monthly” group, and will receive on-ice assessments for 2 hours twice during each 2-month epoch for 10 months. The remaining skaters on the team will be recruited for the “off-ice” group, and will receive instrumented off-ice assessments once every 2 months for 10 months. All skaters will be invited back for a long-term follow-up session at M18. It is expected that there will be high attrition for the final M18 session approximately 20-30%, as skaters’ participation in synchronized skating varies from year to year, as individuals join other teams or pursuits.
- Participants will be asked to fill out questionnaires each 2-month epoch, including patient-reported outcomes and medical history. Special attention will be paid to frequency and nature of medical and health-related interventions, which may consist of increased monitoring, increased visits, diagnostic testing, physical therapy, other therapeutic interventions, or hospitalization.
- Study subjects will not be compensated for their participation; however, they will receive some feedback on their measured performance. Additionally, they will receive credit for future use of the developed software commensurate with a multiple of their study participation time. Frequent feedback from the study skaters and coaches will help refine UI/UX and drive product-market fit.
- Engineering Deliverable. Expansion of database to incorporate multiscale, multimodal data, particularly outcomes data that are collected on a different time scale for this specific aim.
- Engineering Deliverable. Expansion of user interface to allow smart searching on the basis of contextual metadata. As groups get more granular, data sharing permissions should be implemented.
- Commercialization Deliverable. Limited beta release in the figure skating market after resolution of Phase I results will provide metrics to the skater, tallying numbers of each type of movement. These customers, although not study subjects, may opt to donate their data to the central repository, which will further augment our training set with real-world data.
Phase II, Aim #2: Expand the database and user interface infrastructure to automatically annotate, label, and rate individual movements performed in the wild, referencing the ratings through a movement-specific index. This is a key aim that will evolve as new data sets arrive each month. Although it is now widely demonstrated that machine learning approaches are simple with very large data sets, our aim is to map it with a relatively small data set, much as voice-recognition approaches have identified key phonemes to train voice recognition for individual users. Specifically, we will take advantage of this “knowledge representation” of movement space to explore strategies for identifying key foundational pillars of an m-space, to determine which locations must be well-characterized to define the pillars, and which locations may be imputed, with a smaller number of confirmatory samples.
- Data acquisition. Expert rating of video synchronized with cross-sectional wearable motion capture data. Movement samples will be randomized and presented to raters. As this manual component is rate-limiting, augmentation with verified automated ratings will be gradually integrated.
- Engineering Deliverable. Modularization of ratings database and user interface to enable dynamic modification of classifications and potential ratings, with regular curation for duplication/ambiguity.
- R&D Objective. Validation of probabilistic atlas for automated classification of movements performed in the wild based on a library of all existing data. Exploration of the range of dynamic time warping required for recognition may be necessary as timing of movements may vary quite widely. It may be reasonable to
    Research Strategy Page 79

 Contact PD/PI: Ying, Sarah
consider inherently scaled approaches such as wavelet decomposition or radial basis function analysis of raw data to efficiently prime dynamic time warping. Additional features beyond the raw data should be explored to guide machine learning approaches, including standard approaches such as support vector machines, Markov random fields, deep learning, random forests, graph-based approaches (stochastic neighbor embedding, UMAP, etc.), statistical shape modeling, etc.
- R&D Objective. Validation of probabilistic atlas for automated rating of movement performed in the wild. Expand range of skaters performing movements, range of raters performing evaluation, check intra- and inter-rater reliability. Consider level set evolution, expanding upon machine learning methodology explored above for automated movement classification.
- Commercialization Deliverable. Enable skaters/coaches to enter their own rating as an added feature. This also forms the basis for outlier detection, as uncurated entry may result in random number entry vs differently scaled rating system.
Phase II, Aim #3: Test the hypothesis that data show unique movement-specific characteristics, and that longitudinal change through manifold modeling can be amenable to automated movement classification in a dimensionally reduced movement space,
- Engineering Deliverable. Modularization of database and user interface to enable visualization of classification categories and ratings manifold, level sets.
- R&D Objective. Parameterization of probabilistic classification atlas for more computationally efficient automated identification of movements performed in the wild. Consider spline modeling, etc.
- R&D Objective. Parameterization of probabilistic ratings atlas for more computationally efficient automated rating of movement performed in the wild. For real-life utility, it will be important to expand the range of skaters performing movements, range of raters performing evaluation, and check intra- and inter-rater reliability. Consider finite element analysis of level sets for different metadata categories.
- R&D Objective. Parameterization of short-term longitudinal trajectories. Examination of long-term trajectories along various dimensions may be helpful to develop models for short-term trajectories, with an eye toward variability of trajectories and power of using short-term trends to predict long-term trends.
- Commercialization Deliverable. Enable skaters/coaches to view automated rating,
Phase II, Aim #4: Test the hypothesis that m-space metrics can be used for development of injury risk models. Historically, in one season (~ yr), we expect that, 2/3 of skaters will receive medical, paramedical, or coach-recommended intervention (including change of training) due to musculoskeletal (MSK) issues, and 1/3 of skaters will miss at least 1 day of practice due to MSK issues, with an average of a week to a month of lost practice time. Thus we expect to have ample data points to assess the potential for earlier intervention.
- Data acquisition. Medical history from skaters participating in longitudinal follow up from Phase II, Aim #1. In addition to self-report of changes in medical, paramedical, and personal health management, skaters will provide medical records as needed, particularly related to MSK issues.
- Engineering Deliverable. Modularization of database and user interface for future interfacing with an electronic medical record. Key considerations include identifying/removing protected health information (PHI) from data research sets while ensuring accurate linkage with other research data; protecting time-related data (dates that could be identifying) while retaining content for analysis.
- R&D Objective. Comparison of on-ice vs off-ice (standard) metrics as predictors of medical intervention. We will assess skating data vs off ice data, and map the trajectory for that single outcome measure from the times of normal performance to the times of the medical intervention point (MIP) for a single outcome measure. Time for intervention may be estimated from empirical data, and risk may be calculated as more data are accumulated. It would be reasonable to consider linearizing transforms or finite element analysis to compare trajectories for subjects in different metadata categories.
- R&D Objective. Development of a composite metric as a predictor of medical intervention. We will explore various forms of multivariate regression analysis to determine trajectory from theoretical healthy performance to the MIP for an individual, essentially creating an individualized composite risk score, retrospectively. By following level set evolution of individualized injury risk over a population (with
           Research Strategy Page 80

 Contact PD/PI: Ying, Sarah
topological constraints), it may be possible to create zones of relative risk for injury (applied cross-sectionally, similar to BMI). Research questions include whether subjects tend to progress in streamlines, or if progression is more stochastic, in which case variability might be an important metric.
- R&D Objective. Assessment of forecasting models to suggest early intervention. MIP will be assessed with respect to individual variability to estimate rates of progression and determination of an potential early intervention point (EIP) that could be determined prospectively. Simulations can determine the power of various models (moving average, exponential smoothing, trend projection, etc.)
- Commercialization Deliverable. Enable skaters/coaches to enter their own medical outcomes and set their own goals to view progress toward performance improvement (or injury recovery)
Phase II, Aim #5: Establish commercial feasibility regarding early detection of injury risk
- Commercial Feasibility Objective. Conduct 100 customer discovery interviews. This will include medical professionals, including physical/occupational therapists, physical medicine/rehab physicians, sports medicine physicians, practice managers, insurance providers, and other payors. This will enable incorporation of product-market fit for a confirmatory study for possible 510(k) vs pre-market approval. Additional interviews will demonstrate manufacturing and marketing feasibility for supply lines, manufacturing for scaled hardware rollout, and clinical integration.
Critical Phase II milestones include: 1) expansion of a back-end database, computational framework for modular analysis, user interface; 2) sufficient data collection to expand algorithms for movement classification and rating in free-form movement; 3) validation of a probabilistic atlas; 4) establishment of commercial feasibility. By the end of Phase II, we expect a full proof of concept of the m-space analysis platform, with full market fit informed by our customer discovery
efforts, as well as POC for the M3A atlasing platform. The tools and heuristic approach will be built and validated to collect and tabulate movements in athletics and in physical therapy; commercial use will fill in our real world understanding of m-space. As this robust foundation is being built, we will seek government, venture, industry support for the dedicated, large-scale clinical trials that will be necessary for the final step in defining absolute clinical risk implications of given areas of m-space(s).
Potential Risks and Alternative Plan
Risk #1: Unable to develop a low-cost wearable
sensor suit for daily use. However, this is a basic
engineering problem, as our software drift
compensation solution will enable us to use
cheaper IMU’s in a well-established field of
extended wear biometric sensors. This will not
commercially viable, we expect and welcome future development of even cheaper, more elegant hardware solutions to democratize and universalize adoption of m-space analysis. Alternative: use Noitom Perception Neuron IMU suits to collect data through Phase II.
Risk #2: Inability to define clinical risk within a movement type. However, we believe our signal is strong: our pilot data suggest a subtle change due to fatigue can be demonstrated even in an n-of-1 trial, a change that is smaller than the minimum detectable difference represented by current semi-quantitative movement disorders ratings scales. Moreover, the real power lies in the widely recognized ability of AI to make distinctions, overfitting rather than overgeneralizing. Although we hope that we will have sufficient clinically relevant data to show clinical trends by the end of Phase II, the movement recognition and verification features will be robust enough to bootstrap collection of a sufficiently large dataset. Alternative: provide raw movement tallies without risk ratings until sufficient data are collected

Dear NIH SBIR Phase 1,
As a Team USA doctor, former Chair of the Sports Science and Medicine Committee for United States Figure Skating, Assistant Professor of Orthopedic Surgery in the Sports Medicine Division at Boston Children’s Hospital, Harvard Medical School, and a board-certified physician in General Family Medicine and Sports Medicine at the Micheli Center for Sports Injury Prevention, a subsidiary of Boston Children’s Hospital that is housed directly on the Skating Club of Boston premises, I am thrilled to extend my support for DeeperEdge's innovative digital health technology proposed in this SBIR application.
I am serving as an unpaid advisor to DeeperEdge and am looking forward to continuing this role with respect to exercise physiology and biomechanical precursors to injury and considerations that may influence this Phase I technical development project. After the proposed M3A technology becomes available, I am looking forward to participating in the design and implementation of a clinical trial testing its utility in prediction of injury risk to inform medical decision making, a study that will be funded through non-SBIR mechanisms.
In my professional career in sports medicine, I have encountered
numerous technologies and methods in digital health. However, they fall short in addressing the critical needs of our field. DeeperEdge’s proposed ADAM technology, with its promise of delivering an accurate and effective human recognition algorithm, has the potential to vastly improve how we approach patient care, enhance treatment methods, and improve access to quality healthcare. The comprehensive nature of this technology could fundamentally transform the collection and utilization of data in clinical and research settings.
Our patient base, including elite athletes and individuals requiring specialized care, has a pressing need for the kind of innovation DeeperEdge promises. The successful development of DeeperEdge’s technology through this SBIR grant could lead to its rapid adoption among my patients and colleagues.
Upon successful completion of this SBIR project, I am particularly interested in exploring opportunities for collaboration between DeeperEdge and the broader research community. Our combined expertise would also facilitate future applications and partnerships within the broader medical and sports science communities.

Dear NIH Review Board,
NIH NIAMS SBIR Letter of Support
As the current board member of Huntington's Disease Society America NE Chapter and former Head of Commercial at uniQure from 2019 to 2023 with a track record in driving commercial success for innovative healthcare products in rare diseases, I would like to express my enthusiastic support for DeeperEdge's proposed M3A project, a low-profile wearable sensor solution to identify and rate individual movements in daily life. My experience in building global commercial functions and launching commercially successful products provides me with a unique perspective on the potential impact of the M3A technology.
M3As application in clinical settíngs, particularly in the assessment of movement, aligns with current needs in various therapeutic areas, particularly for uniQure's AMT-130 gene therapy program targeting Huntington's chorea, a devastating inherited neurodegenerative movement disorder. This precise movement analysis could provide a more sensitive, continuous, quantitative clinical outcome measure than what is currently available to measure movements in daily life. lf successful, this could allow for earlier detection of clinical effects of therapeutic intervention in movement disorders, thus accelerating the possibility of bringing cures to our patients, who are dying while waiting.
I see this technology playing a critical role not just in future clinical trials, but also in routine clinical care across multiple healthcare domains.
lncidentally, the first vertical, addressing the figure skating market, holds particular significance for me personally. My daughter is a competitive figure skater at the national level, and avoidance of injury is every parent's prime concern. Technologies like these for identification of injury risk are desperately needed, yet they are difficult to develop and commercialize because the market size is small. However, this small but exquisitely well-defined market is invaluable, as it can be used to develop the scientific methodology precisely because it is so well-defTned. Then, the technology can then be applied to other, large markets - think Parkinson's, aging, etc. - that may have been too poorly defined for methodological development.
The innovation and potential of the M3A technology align strongly with my vision of integrating advanced healthcare solutions into commercial and clinical practices. I am eager to see the project's successful development and am optimistic about potential opportunities for collaboration in the future

In my dual capacities as the Director of Performing Arts Medicine and an Associate Professor at Harvard Medical School, I have been at the forefront of research into sports and performing arts medicine and have an active study including an injury registry and a screening program for performing arts athletes.
What excites me about the M3A technology is its potential in not just diagnostics but also the treatment protocols in sports medicine. I can see the applicability to our injury prevention program as part of our assessment strategies for improved performance.
In support of this endeavor, I lend not just my endorsement but also my keen interest in witnessing the transformative impact this project will have on sports medicine, both toward science and direct use in patient care. Not only would I be excited to include this technology in my own practice, but I would be a strong supporter of its use in many areas of sports medicine.
With regards and anticipation for a healthier future in sports,
Dr. Andrea Stracciolini

NINDS SBIR Phase 1 Letter of Support
I am writing to express my enthusiastic support for the Phase I/II SBIR proposal submitted by DeeperEdge. As a two-time Olympian, Olympic medalist, and national champion in figure skating, I have firsthand experience of the challenges and opportunities in the world of competitive sports.
My journey in figure skating began at a young age, leading to a U.S. championship title at 15 and a fourth-place finish at the Vancouver Olympics at 16. Throughout my career, which included becoming the first U.S. lady to land a triple axel at the 2018 Olympic Games, I have faced numerous challenges, including significant injuries.
The aspect of injury prevention is particularly close to my heart. Throughout my career, injuries were a constant battle, impacting not just my performance but also my overall well-being. The preventative capabilities of M3A could be instrumental in identifying potential injury risks early on, allowing for timely intervention and potentially prolonging the careers of many athletes.
In my current role as an advisor, I am committed to providing subjects to participate in the study. My clients, of all ages and levels, will benefit greatly from involvement in the study and continued tracking. I firmly believe in the M3A potential to enhance performance, prevent injuries, and level the playing field for all athletes, and I wholeheartedly support this SBIR proposal.
Sincerely,
land
